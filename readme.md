# Student Depression Classifier

## Classifiers Built:
Logistic Regression  

Random Forests  

Ensemble Models - Random Forest + Logistics Regression  

Support Vector Machine  

Neural Network  

## Data Source:  
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hopesb/student-depression-dataset)  

**Dataset Features:**  
Observations: 27899  
Features: 18  
Key features:  
Academic.Pressure | Work.Pressure | Job.Satisfaction | Sleep.Duration | Financial.Stress | Work.Study.Hours | Dietery.Habits |

#### AIM:
To develop and optimize machine learning models suitable for data. Tune the hyperparameters comapring the accuracy using F1-scores and cross-validation.  

#### ACCURACY SCORES:  
Known Dataset  |  Unknown Dataset  
Logistic Regression: 86 %  |  86.3 %  
Random Forest: 84.7 %  |  86.3 %  
Ensemble Model:  86 %  
Support Vector Machine: 86.6 %  |  73.5 %  
Neural Network: Did not converge in the given time.  

#### CONCLUSION:  
The neural network model did not converge and thus the model failed.
The logistic regression model gave highest accuracy since the data was linear.  
Random forest model capped highest accuracy at 200 trees.
